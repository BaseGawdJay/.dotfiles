# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .linux.sh
Is my own customized way of checking renaming and making a directory for information to passed around. If ran correctly the files should be overwritten and changed.
## .cleanup.sh 
Is my way of removing changes made by the script after use. If used correctly the files should be remove completely or replaced.
## Makefile
The makefile will execute both the commands when specified correctly.
# .dotfiles
